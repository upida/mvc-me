# PHP MVC BY UPIDA

I built this just to review the results of learning OOP. I finished following the OOP playlist at Programmer Zaman Now few weeks ago. I read some repositories about simple mvc in github others people before. And then I am modifying and breaking to be like this. Feel free to suggest or just use it.

## Installing

Installation is super-simple. Grab [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) and run `composer install` in the Git repository directory.

## Explanation

3 primer bullet-points of mvc are:

- **The Model** - Concerned with data. Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting.
- **The View** - Concerned with appearance. How the application looks.
- **The Controller** - Concerned with behaviour. How the application acts and flows.

and I added **The Config** for other needs that no coverage.
